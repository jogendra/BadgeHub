## Demo/Example
For demo:

```ruby
$ pod try BadgeHub
```

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

```ruby
$ cd Example
```

```ruby
$ pod install
```

If you don't have CocoaPods installed, grab it with `[sudo] gem install cocoapods`.

```ruby
$ open BadgeHub.xcworkspace
```

## Requirements

- iOS 10.0 or later
- Swift 5+
- Xcode 10+

## Installation

#### CocoaPods

BadgeHub is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'BadgeHub'
```

#### Manual Installation
Just drag the `BadgeHub.swift` files into your project.

## Usage

Initialization.

```swift
let hub = BadgeHub(view: yourView) // Initially count set to 0
```

Initializer for setting badge to bar button items.

```swift
let hub = BadgeHub(barButtonItem: UIBarButtonItem)
```

Increase count value by **1**.

```swift
hub.increment()
```

Increase count by some int value.

```swift
hub.increment(by: Int)
```

Decrease count value by **1**.

```swift
hub.decrement()
```

Decrease count by some int value.

```swift
hub.decrement(by: Int)
```

Set count to static integer value.

```swift
hub.setCount(newCount: Int)
```
Get value of current count on badge.

```swift
hub.getCurrentCount() // returns Int value of current count.
```

Combine actions

```swift
hub.increment()
hub.pop()
hub.blink()
```
**Don't forget to `import BadgeHub`**

## Customization

Change the color of the notification circle, also the text color of count label.

![setCircleColor](https://i.imgur.com/MrsGB4p.gif)

```swift
hub.setCircleColor(_ circleColor: UIColor?, label labelColor: UIColor?)
```
Change the border color and border width of the circle

![Custom](https://i.imgur.com/PhlDWXW.gif)

```swift
hub.setCircleBorderColor(_ color: UIColor?, borderWidth width: CGFloat)
```
Set the frame of the notification badge circle relative to the view.

![setCircle](https://i.imgur.com/8CtI0nf.gif)

```swift
hub.setCircleAtFrame(_ frame: CGRect)
```
Move the circle (left/right or up/down).

```swift
hub.moveCircleBy(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat)
```
Changes the size of the circle. setting a scale of 1 has no effect.

```swift
hub.scaleCircleSize(by scale: CGFloat)
```
Hide the count (Blank Badge). Keep in mind that this method is for hiding just count, not the badge.

![hideCount](https://i.imgur.com/E3hOrX5.gif)

```swift
hub.hideCount()
```
Show count again on the badge.

![showCount](https://i.imgur.com/VHdp2vO.gif)

```swift
hub.showCount()
```

Hide the badge from your view.

```swift
hub.hide()
```

Show again the badge. Badge will staye hidden even after calling this method, if current count on badge is <= 0.

```swift
hub.show()
```
Set max count which can be displayed. This method can be used to restrict the maximum count can be set on the badge. Default value for max count is `100000`. If you increase current count to more than max count, badge will display it like `500+` (if max count is 500).

```swift
hub.setMaxCount(to: Int)
```

Set the font of the count label.

```swift
hub.setCountLabelFont(_ font: UIFont?)
```
Get the current font set on the count label.

```swift
hub.getCountLabelFont()
```

Set alpha to badge.

```swift
hub.setAlpha(alpha: CGFloat)
```

## Animations

Pop out and pop in the badge.

![Pop](https://i.imgur.com/aQ0sOtZ.gif)

```swift
hub.pop()
```
Make badge blinking.

![Blink](https://imgur.com/AEgi5tW.gif)

```swift
hub.blink()
```
Animation that jumps similar to macOS dock icons.

![Bump](https://i.imgur.com/238tikf.gif)

```swift
hub.bump()
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Notification isn't showing up!**
* If the hub value is < 1, the circle hides.  Try calling `increment()`.
* Make sure the view you set the hub to is visible (i.e. did you call `self.view.addSubview(yourView)`?).
* Make sure you didn't call `hideCount()` anywhere. Call `showCount()` to counter this.

**Badge is not hiding even after setting value to 0**
* Make sure you are setting zero count on correct BadgeHub instance.
* Try calling `checkZero()` method after setting count to 0.
* Varify if current count is <= 0 by calling `getCurrentCount()` method.
* Keep in mind that `hideCount()` method is for hiding just count, not the badge. To hide the badge, simply call `hide()`.

**It isn't incrementing / decrementing properly!**
* Any count < 1 doesn't show up. If you need help customizing this, reach out to me!

**The circle is in a weird place**
* If you want to resize the circle, use `scaleCircleSize(by scale: CGFloat)`. 0.5 will give you half the size, 2 will give you double.
* If the circle is just a few pixels off, use `moveCircleBy(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat)`. This shifts the circle by the number of pixels given.
* If you want to manually set the circle, call `setCircleAtFrame(_ frame: CGRect)` and give it your own CGRect.

**Something else isn't working properly**
* Use GitHub's issue reporter to submit a new issue.
* If you think you fix that, feel free to open a pull request fixing the same.
* Shoot me an email at jogendra.iitbhu@gmail.com.
